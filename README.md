Our motivation for this project is to assist users in managing unexpected situations more effectively. The incident manager was created to address the challenges of efficiently handling unforeseen incidents, aiming to simplify the process of incident reporting. The goal was to devise a solution that makes incident reporting simple, allowing users to have a smooth and manageable experience.
Lessons Learned

Throughout the development process, we encountered challenges, particularly in implementing the connection between Angular and CRUD to MongoDB. CRUD, essential for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, was a necessary component. Angular proved to be a useful framework for developing user-friendly single-page applications.
